# Cristatus Core
This repository has the standard classes used in all other Cristatus projects. This is currently a work in progress.
There are lots of things to do:

**For `Rational`, I need to**

1. add arithmetic methods to `Rational.java`
2. run tests for all these methods.
3. write JavaDoc

*More classes to be added.*
